# Computing Machinery II - Assignment 4
Raspberry Pi Game, Joystick, and Accelerometer Control

Assignment description:

In this assignment, you will repeat what you did in assignment 3, but without the aid of the General Purpose Input and
Output (GPIO) and I2C device drivers on Raspbian.

This will require that you map the physical memory of your Raspberry Pi (RPi) into the virtual memory space of
your program, then read and write the GPIO registers to perform the physical input and output operations required.

Use the following two devices, and get them to work with a Python game on the RPI using (almost bare metal) programming:
1. a push-button joystick, and
2. an accelerometer
